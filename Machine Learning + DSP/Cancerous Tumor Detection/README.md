### **Introduction:** 

  It goes without saying how machine learning is a heavily researched field today. And there is a good reason why. Machine learning has proven itself as a magical tool - it is amazing to see what a bunch of numbers in the form of clean data can do. This is the reason why I wanted to do a project which could have a popularity in its application. This project is about determining if the benign colon tumor is cancerous or not. 


### **Dataset:**

### **Target Labels:**
  Class 0: Tumor is cancerous. 
  Class 1: Tumor is not cancerous 


### **Method:** 
  1) Reduced the data features from 589824 to 2976 using Principal Component Analysis

  2) Used the RBF Kernel of SVM to classify the images into two classes - cancerous and non-cancerous. 
 
 
## **Accuracy = 94%**
